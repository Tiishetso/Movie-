# 🎬 Movie Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a movies dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, analyze trends, and visualize patterns in the data.

# Objectives

Identify trends in movie production and popularity.

Analyze the correlation between different factors like budget, gross earnings, and ratings.

Examine how different genres perform in terms of revenue and audience reception.

Investigate the impact of directors, writers, and stars on movie success.

Detect any missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers in the dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about movies, including:
- **Name, Rating, Genre, Year, Release Date, Score, Votes, Director, Writer, Star, Country, Budget, Gross, Production Company, Runtime**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Analysis)

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
- Distribution of movie ratings  
- Top-grossing movies  
- Relationship between budget and gross earnings  
- Trends in movie genres over the years

# Steps in EDA

Load and Inspect Data. Make sure the files are in the same folder.

Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

Understand data types and perform necessary conversions.

Descriptive Statistics

Calculate summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.

Identify data distributions and potential outliers.

Data Visualization

Plot histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to explore relationships.

Use correlation matrices to analyze connections between variables.

Insights and Findings

Extract key takeaways from the analysis.

Compare performance across different genres, years, and countries.
